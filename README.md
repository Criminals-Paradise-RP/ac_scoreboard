### Dependency

You can use the scoreboard without a server framework, but the group list won't be available.  
Optional dependencies are [ox_core](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core), [es_extended](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy) or [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) for group list feature.
